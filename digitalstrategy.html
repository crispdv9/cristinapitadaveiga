          <p>An <a href="https://www.politesi.polimi.it/handle/10589/173903">Atlas of Gentrification</a> is my final Master Thesis Project.</p>
          <p>The final project pretends to show stories of cities affected by the process of gentrification through the use of digital narratives and data visualization. To do so, I collected and analised data from different sources as Twitter, Instagram or street view. The investigation is divided by three lenses: investment, commercial structure and vacation rental.</p>
          <p>I investigated about other projects related to cities. To visualize it I designed all the website and create a mockup. Regarding data, I analysed data data from Google Street View; Twitter and Instagram with different tools. </p>

          <p>The “Atlas of gentrification” is a communication artifact built to help the promotion of a social discussion and awareness following a digital narrative. Gentrification does not happen everywhere in the same way and is a phenomenon extremely affected by its locality. How to embrace the locality of the phenomenon in order to make it visible and to tell audiences about it? How can data be combined with local citizen’s stories to design digital narratives that make the phenomenon of gentrification more understandable to create knowledge and awareness?</p>
         <p>This thesis is presented with the hypothesis that communication design can help to promote a social discussion related to social phenomena by bringing into light a common representation of the discussion for amplifying knowledge over them; democratizing information and inviting marginalized actors to be aware</p>
         <div class="tesis-gif"><img  src="fotos/mockup.png"/></div>  
         <p> Using different forms of data material and creating a narrative can be possible to explore, explain and to visualize a process as gentrification, sometimes invisible in the city. Giving context to the data it’s possible to visualize this issue and to create a big image of it, but also to see the differences between cities regarding the same phenomenon. Gentrification is a very complex phenomenon. </p>
         <p>The result is a website with a linear storytelling which shows the process of gentrificacion in Milan, Madrid, London, Paris and Berlin. I tested the website in citizens and in experts from different disciplines related to sociology or urbanism. Moreover, I developed all the design process and created a wireframe for the prototype.</p>
